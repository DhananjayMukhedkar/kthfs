Exercise1 : 
  Place exc1 folder under src.
  /The image all topics.png shows the plot of active topics.
  
Exercise2 :
  There is jupyter notebook file and also the python script.
  I am currently getting the output on my local notebook file.  However apparently there are some library dependencies of Animation     library due to which it does not run sometimes .I am trying to debug.
The ex2_animation3.mp4 shows a small recording of the live plotting .
